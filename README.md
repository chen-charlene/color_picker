**Introduction**
In this project we created a color picker that allows users to capture colors from real world objects and adjust its opacity. When a user hovers the RGB sensor over a color, the color gets displayed on the LCD screen. Users can then adjust the color’s opacity using a potentiometer. To save a color for future reference, pressing the button will display the color’s hex code on the serial monitor.
